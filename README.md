## Description
**The Fallout Wasteland Resource Tracker** is a combined webpage and database built for the express purpose of allowing RPers from the NS Roleplay Region known as the Fallout Wasteland to track and manage their resources without having to keep track of all their numbers in their head or in their dispatches themselves.

## Installation
This application was built using React.js, CSS, Javascript, and the npms and helpers listed below. MYSQL Workbench was also used for ease of testing and querying the database, though it is not required.

Required npms:

- [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize)
- [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
- [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
- [handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars)
- [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp)
- [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer)
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (Optional - to protect sensitive information)

Other Helpers:
- [bootstrap](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap)

## Usage
To access the program via `localhost`, a connection to the server must be made using MYSQL. After installing the necessary npms and providing the database access criteria, the connection can be made using the terminal CLI by evoking `npm start`. Alternatively, a link to the deployed online application is available below.
